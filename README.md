## About Me
***
Hi, I'm Alex! üëãüèª

I have over 5 years of professional experience in a range of roles which include software engineering, data analytics, and control systems engineering.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities centered around data analytics to continue to use my technical experience and knowledge to discover trends in the data that surrounds us and use those data-driven insights to inspire action for business objectives.

I've learned that the work that I've enjoyed the most in all of my previous roles have revolved around using the data at hand to tell a story.

My goal is to cultivate a career path in which I am able to more closely align my desire to work with data and use those discoveries to help answer key questions for any team!

**Primary Tool:** Microsoft Excel

**Demonstrated Skills**: Reference Functions (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDIRECT), Data Validation (lists), Charts (Bar, Column), Tables (structured reference using table headers)

This is a dynamic dashboard built in Microsoft Excel which displays all of the major statistics of a selected NFL player (or team defense) for the 2021-2022 seasons and the total amount of points that player scored in fantasy football.

Additionally, there's functionality to compare that player's statistics and fantasy scores with the rest of the players in the league so that the performance of the selected player can be measured more easily. This league average measurement can be dynamically altered to include all players in the league or only players who play the same position as the selected player. You can also set a variable minimum qualifier statistic so that the selected player is only measured against other players who meet a certain threshold.

Data visualization is provided and dynamically changes based on the selected setting and showcases the player's fantasy scoring performance as compared to the rest of the league (visualized as a single bar chart), as well as each measured statistic as compared to the rest of the league (visualized as 8 unique column charts). Additionally, there are 2 pie charts that display the distribution of fantasy points for the selected player's statistics - allowing you to see the statistical areas that this player is the strongest/weakest in.

This allows you to easily decipher how the selected player performed as compared to the league average.

**Input:** Player Selection, Fantasy Scoring System (Standard, Half PPR, Full PPR), Compare Against League/Position, Minimum Qualifier, and two Custom Stat Metrics.
